Quality on Demand API - CAMARA Project
This repository implements the Quality on Demand (QoD) API from the CAMARA Project, which provides a standardized mechanism to request, retrieve, extend, and terminate a mobile connectivity session with improved performance (in terms of bandwidth and latency).

The API enables mobile applications to trigger an enhanced quality of service (QoS) profile between the user equipment (UE) and the application server (AS). Additionally, it allows specifying parameters such as the expected session duration, ports, and a notification URL to receive updates when the session ends.

The CAMARA QoD API is designed to optimize network performance, ensuring that mobile applications can run smoothly and efficiently, especially in scenarios requiring higher bandwidth or lower latency.
